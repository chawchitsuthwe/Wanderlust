			<p>Inle Lake  (a freshwater lake )located in the Nyaungshwe Township of Taunggyi District of Shan State, part of Shan Hills in Myanmar (Burma). 
			It is the second largest lake in Myanmar with an estimated surface area of 44.9 square miles (116 km2), and one of the highest at an elevation of 2,900 feet (880 m). 
			During the dry season, the average water depth is 7 feet (2.1 m), with the deepest point being 12 feet (3.7 m), but during the rainy season this can increase by 5 feet 
			(1.5 m).In June 2015, it became Myanmar's first designated place of World Network of Biosphere Reserves.[3] It was one of-20 places added at the Unesco's 27th Man and 
			the Biosphere (MAB) International Coordinating Council (ICC) meeting.[4] Since 2018 it has been designated as a protected Ramsar site.The people of Inle Lake (called Intha), some 70,000 of them, live in four cities bordering the lake, 
			in numerous -small villages along the lake's shores, and on the lake itself. The entire lake area is in Nyaung Shwe township.Transportation on the lake is traditionally 
			by small boats, or by somewhat larger boats fitted with single cylinder inboard diesel engines. Local fishermen are known for practicing a distinctive rowing 
			style which involves standing at the stern on one leg and wrapping the other leg around the oar. This unique style evolved out of necessity as the lake is covered by 
			reeds and floating plants.</p>

			<h4>Asiatico Pub</h4>
			<p>If you're looking for an escape from Myanmar for a few hours, this is the place to come. Pub Asiatico is decked out with a pool table and 
			live sport on the TVs, and serves up foreign beers and liquor, as well as highly rated pizzas, in a faintly sterile atmosphere.
			Asiatico Pub opened in February 2016. The now most iconic pub in the state, the biggest in Myanmar, wearing a fierce Tiger head as a logo, 
			was born of a concept previously developped by Asiatico Group in Thailand. Asiatico was offered a second life when the Tiger set its foot on the lands of Shan State. 
			Indeed, Asiatico Group cooked up a bold and unique design concept consisting of an amazing variety of local artifacts and a warehouse like architecture. 
			Here melds traditional ideas from the Shan hills with an international touch, flavored with oversized Gigante Pizzas and a melting pot of fusion food, a blend of 
			deliciously concocted fresh products, straight out of its furnace.

			<h4>Inlay Cat Village</h4>
			<p>The Burmese cat sanctuary is situated in the Heritage House in Inle Lake. The house is located on an island at the center of the lake, which is completely 
			isolated from the neighboring areas, making it an ideal place for preserving the Burmese pure cat breed.
			Visiting this island is a wonderful experience. Tourists can enjoy the beautiful landscapes of the Inle lake as well as the peaceful atmosphere at 
			the Burmese cat village while the best part of the journey is meeting and playing with these lovely animals. These cats are much adored by the locals that they even 
			have small wooden houses across the island built just for them. However, visitors can only cuddle with these lovely fellas between 11 am and 2 pm 
			(total of five 30-minute visiting periods). The reason for this time limit is to prevent the cats from being overwhelmed and stressed out.
