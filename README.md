# Wanderlust
The aim of this project is to help the foreigners who want to come and visit to Myanmar find the hotels to stay, restaurants and suitable transportation companies. The users will be able to give reviews and ratings to the hotels and restaurants so that the users who are about to visit Myanmar can decide whether they should choose to stay in that hotels or to have a meal in that restaurants.

The website will provide the information of hotels, restaurants, airlines, transportation express services and so on. The normal users will be able to access the information, give ratings and reviews to intended hotels, restaurants and so on. The business users will be able to update their hotel or restaurant pages.
